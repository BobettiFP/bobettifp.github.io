## TL;DR
이 기술보고서는 **프로세스 마이닝 산출물(DFG, 이벤트 로그, 프로세스 모델 등)을 텍스트로 추상화**해 LLM이 이해·추론하도록 하고, **직답(Direct), 다중 프롬프트(Multi-prompt), DB 쿼리 생성** 세 전략으로 질의·검증하는 방법을 실험한다. GPT-4와 Bard는 **절차적/선언적 모델을 꽤 잘 해석**했고, **오브젝트 중심 프로세스 마이닝**에서도 강점을 보였으며, **공정성(fairness) 평가**에도 잠재력이 확인됐다.

## Abstract 분해
This technical report describes the intersection of process mining and large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the abstraction of **traditional and object-centric process mining** artifacts into textual format. 

- Traditional Process Mining:

- Object-centric Process Mining:

We introduce and explore various prompting strategies: 

**direct answering**, where the large language model directly addresses user queries; 

- Direct Answering Prompting

**multi-prompt answering**, which allows the model to incrementally build on the knowledge obtained through a series of prompts; 

- Multi-prompt Answering:

and the **generation of database queries**, 

- Database Query Generation:

facilitating the validation of hypotheses against the original event log. 

Our assessment considers two large language models, GPT-4 and Google’s Bard, under various contextual scenarios across all prompting strategies. 

Results indicate that these models exhibit a robust understanding of key process mining abstractions,

with notable proficiency in interpreting both declarative and procedural process models. 

- Declarative Process Model:

- Procedural Process Model:
In addition, we find that both models demonstrate strong performance in the object-centric setting, which could significantly propel the advancement of the object-centric process mining discipline.

Additionally, these models display a noteworthy capacity to evaluate various concepts of fairness in process mining.

This opens the door to more rapid and efficient assessments of the fairness of process mining event logs, which has significant implications for the field.
